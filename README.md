# multicarrier_autoencoder
This is the first implementation of multicarrier autoencoder communication systems in the following paper:

T. V. Luong, Y. Ko and et. al, "Deep learning aided multicarrier systems", IEEE Trans. Wireless Commun., under review, June, 2020.
- Requirements: Tensorflow 1.15, Keras 2.0.8.

Note that further files for multi-user MC-AE systems and the baselines will be updated soon.
